					<p>You might have wondered about the word 'sponge mode', which I used in my intro. What does a sponge do? Since catching the coding virus, I am soaking in every little bit of knowledge I can get my hands on. How did I end up as a sponge? Well, let me tell you..</p>
					<p>Around 1 year ago, while being a Digital Marketing Manager for adidas in Amsterdam, I found myself gravitating more and more towards technology. Mainly working on (amazing) campaign concepts, I missed a closer connection to our website and apps. At the same time, I started a weekly Creative Coding course at Makerversity where I learnt how to create art with JavaScript library p5.
					</p>
					<p> While discovering this beautiful intersection between aesthetics and logic, I got hooked and skipped my usual metro stop. I decided to take on a different path and follow a new born passion, so I left adidas and signed up for a full-time Web Development Course at New York Code and Design Academy in Amsterdam. And here we go, 3 months and 220 GitHub commits later, I am shaping my path as web developer.
					</p>
					<p>My current stack covers: JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, SQL, Sequelize and React, jQuery, HTML, CSS. I love the logical puzzle challenge within development, connecting different data sources and crafting them to be used in any imaginable context. I would love to get more experience working with databases and APIs, preferrably around data visualization.

					<!-- 					<p>Reflecting on 7 years of working in different jobs, also in context of my experience at digital school Hyper Island, there are some things that are very important to me at any workplace. I want to work at a place where communication is transparent and knowledge accessible. I would like decisions to be data-driven, user-centric and constantly improved. And ideally this happens in an agile process setup.
