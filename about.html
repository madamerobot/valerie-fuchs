					<p>'Sponge mode', was is that supposed to mean? Since catching the coding virus, I am soaking in every little bit of knowledge I can get my hands on. How I ended up as a sponge? Well, let me tell you..</p>
					<p>Around 1 year ago, while being a Digital Marketing Manager for adidas in Amsterdam, I found myself gravitating more and more towards technology. Mainly working on (amazing) campaign concepts, I missed a closer connection to websites and apps. At the same time, I started a weekly Creative Coding course at <span class="underlined"><a href="http://makerversity.org/amsterdam/" target=_blank >Makerversity</a></span> where I learnt how to create art with JavaScript <span class="underlined"><a href="https://p5js.org/" target=_blank >library p5</a></span>.
					</p>
					<p> While discovering this beautiful intersection between aesthetics and logic, I got hooked and skipped my usual metro stop. I decided to take on a different path and follow a new born passion, so I left adidas and signed up for a full-time Web Development Course at <span class="underlined"><a href="https://nycda.com/amsterdam" target=_blank >New York Code and Design Academy in Amsterdam</a></span>. And here we go, 3 months and a couple of GitHub commits later, I am shaping my path as web developer.
					</p>
					<p>My current stack covers: JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, SQL, Sequelize and React, jQuery, HTML, CSS. I love logical puzzles, e.g. connecting different data sources and crafting them to be used in any imaginable context. I would love to get more experience working with databases and APIs, preferrably around data visualization.
